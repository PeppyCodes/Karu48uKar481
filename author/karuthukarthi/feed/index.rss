					<description><![CDATA[This blog is all about how planning and documentation saved me from unwanted blames during tough times in an initiative.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In this blog, I would explain how planning and documentation saved me at difficult times.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If You Fail to Plan, You Plan to Fail!</p><cite>Benjamin Franklin</cite></blockquote>



<p>Luckily I had known this before the project start, so I have done the following before and during the project life cycle.</p>



<ul><li>Finalized the Project Scope</li><li>Built High-Level Business Analysis approach</li><li>Made sure stakeholders are Identified and planned to get engaged</li><li>A measure of success in project implementation had been set</li><li>Change management had been introduced</li><li>Documenting the Change in scope at every stage</li></ul>



<p>The project started, the objective of the project was to save the time of employees so that the efficiency of the man-hour is improved. Its a startup Business Intelligence firm.</p>



<p>Requirements and designs are frequently updated, that&#8217;s good. because change is good. Even the high-level requirement had been updated every day, it&#8217;s like today&#8217;s update is no way relevant to yesterdays work. But here is where things started to get a little fishy.</p>



<p>Since the deadline was approaching Business Analysis work had been started in a hurry without having proper time to analyze to what extent this change aligns to the scope of the project. </p>



<p>The project had been moving on this phase for some weeks, I started to sense that the project is not going in the right direction. every stakeholder and business analysis team had been working on day and night but the rock wasn&#8217;t moving an inch.</p>



<p>I felt like I and all stakeholders were trying to push and pull the big rock, but unsure of the direction, Though directions had been shown.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="175" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/blog-rock3-1/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-rock3-1.jpg" data-orig-size="1919,859" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="blog-rock3-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-rock3-1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-rock3-1.jpg?w=750" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-rock3-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-175" /></figure>



<p>In both Figure 1 and Figure 2 lot of efforts had been put into, But look closely</p>



<ul><li><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The rock had been pushed and pulled in full effort, the direction of different person are different and incongruent, so the rock remains almost stationary and most efforts are wasted.</li><li><strong>Figure 2: </strong>The rock had been pushed and pulled in full effort, the direction of different person are different. But collectively the project moves in a direction. though the progress is little slow this is what should happen..</li></ul>



<p>This made me to decide not to accept all changes just like that instead put those change into a change management process so that the changes are relevant to the objective of the initiative. This made the stakeholders to loose the collaboration.</p>



<p>No Time to think, just discuss and do. Although in this tough situation where I didn&#8217;t have proper time to eat, were sometimes working even on Sundays, I tried to document everything that&#8217;s happening. At some point in time, I even felt &#8220;I should work instead of documenting because documentation wastes time&#8221; but my inner consciousness said documenting is worth the time. </p>



<p>Weeks moved on like this. New Changes today, which is less relevant to yesterday, which is very less relevant to goal and objective of the initiative.</p>



<p>One fine day I got questions from the client</p>



<ul><li>What had you guys been doing all these days?</li><li>Where are the benefits?</li><li>We don&#8217;t have any results yet? deadline is approaching !!!</li></ul>



<p>I tried to explain the number of changes without alignment lead to this &#8220;the rock story&#8221;. They were not convinced. Then I took out the documentation which I did on every day, presented to them. Client agreed then.</p>



<p>The client requested for restarting the project, But they want some traditional methodology to handle their work. I very well knew that it will lead to failure down the line, explained them with enough data and lessons learned that the project will move towards point of failure. Client was pretty much stuck on the current methodology. I felt that starting again will definitely lead to failure again which is waste of time and money for client as well as me. Hence I dropped the project.</p>



<p>Had I not done the documentation and explained the client, the entire blame of project failure would have dropped on Business Analysis. Good that I was considerably good in planning and documentation which saved me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We have 2 answers for this question</p>



<p>Will explain all of these three</p>



<ol><li>Possible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</li><li>Impossible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</li></ol>



<h2>Possible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</h2>



<p>This is a booking a cab and travelling to the destination. The driver knows how to get you to the destination. In this case, you have a very fixed template in the execution of the project hence you will be having a full understanding of the project, how it works, the associated risks, the time required, human resources required, budget involved, stakeholders involved, inside scope and outside the scope.</p>



<p>Requirements like system upgrade, which are repeated initiative where the lessons learned from previous initiatives make yourself very clear and confident on this project execution. This works well in predictive methodology</p>



<h2>Impossible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</h2>



<p>This is where things get a little tricky. The client may not have a 100% clear idea of what they want. You could even ask how can a client ask you for a solution if they themselves are not clear on what they exactly want. in the current disruptive business environment the everything changes so fast, there were days where you will be excited when you just receive an item you ordered online a week earlier. but see now you want the item you ordered tomorrow itself or even today itself some cases you expect in few hours. the people mindset changes, which changes the market, which changes the competitors, which forces your client to change to the market to survive.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why your client may not be 100% clear of what they want. The reality is infinitely complex no matter how hard you think, how mature you are, how expert you are, you may not be able to predict everything accurately. Hence you won&#8217;t get 100% of requirement at any time. You have to start your work as soon as you verify the requirement of sufficient quality and validate your requirement with alignment with the goal then start your work.</p>



<p>Things may change anytime that&#8217;s a big risk, but not to worry that risk can be medicated with flexibility.</p>

<h2>Fear</h2>



<p>When I stepped on the weighing machine the weighing machine said I am 100 Kg. It was the record high in my life. I pretty much know once I pass this border my weight will be in triple digits. I will attract diabetes, blood pressure, heart attack and cancer. That instant I decided to do something to not cross this weight.</p>



<h2>Anger and Sadness</h2>



<p>I was an athlete during my school days, Sprint or Endurance whatever you take I was a king, if my friends chase me on the game I will make sure that everyone is tired of chasing me before I rest myself. Only if the luck is against me I will be the catcher, if I am one I will make sure that the game is over in 2 minutes. Having such a history how did I become fat in the first place?</p>



<h2>How I Became fat?</h2>



<p>Being an athlete I met with a small accident during my school days which stopped me from running for more than 6 months. Then I got enough time to study, so I started to gain weight.</p>



<h2>Phase 1: Immature Work on Weight Reduction</h2>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure where to start the process of weight reduction, consulted some gym, dietician, doctors all advice which I got was drink protein powder, do liposuction blah blah&#8230; Lucky I didn&#8217;t go for any of these.</p>



<p>I straight away started doing crunches, running, etc&#8230; because I want a quick result. Those resulted in Sevier body ache. I could bear the pain and proceed further, then when I checked the weight after a couple of weeks, I realized that I reduced 100 grams. Which slapped on my face I was totally demotivated and I quit weight reduction.</p>



<h2>Phase 2: Less Immature Work on Weight Reduction</h2>



<p>One of My Friend&#8217;s Colleague Mr Vishnu Dev whose mother, father, grandmother, grandfather everyone was a doctor. He came up with a suggestion post discussing with all of them. &#8220;<strong>Speed Walking</strong>&#8220;. Had he not came up with that suggestion then it would have been very terrible for me to reduce my weight. Every day 1 hour I was engaged in Speed Walking. This reduced my weight slowly but steadily, I was motivated when I stood on the weighing machine.</p>



<h2>Phase 3: Life tested my Persistence</h2>



<p>Those happy days of weight reduction didn&#8217;t last long, I was involved in a project where the project demanded me to work even on many Sundays. The project was a terrible failure. I would have mentioned how that project failed in another Business Analysis Blog. But this blog is for weight reduction. That stress made me gain weight again, though I was in the controlled intake. I Tried meditation to relief my stress but didn&#8217;t work.</p>



<p>Standing Back in weighing machine made me sad, but I had hope that&nbsp;<strong>&#8220;Speed Walking&#8221;</strong>&nbsp;will work. But something different happened in my life.</p>



<h2>Phase 4: My Life, My Body, My Rules</h2>



<p>My sister got married, her husband was a fitness kind of person, Nice Guy Mr Sampath. I requested advice and tips from him. Had he given advice I would not have learned so much, instead, he said one simple sentence.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Everybody in the world is unique, the rule which worked for me may not work for you</p><cite>Mr Sampath Nagarajan</cite></blockquote>



<p>He brought me a lot of fitness magazine, asked me to read those and make my own rules as I am the person who best understands my body chemistry. That was new to me. I did as he said.</p>



<p>My Sister Mrs Aarthi Gifted me Fitness Devices, Athletic Wear to motivate me.</p>



<h3>Made my Own Rule Version 1</h3>



<p>Here are the rules I followed, I Challenged and Fought against my body to Reduce</p>



<ol><li>Speed Walk at 6 Km/Hour. Everyday 1-hour walk.</li><li>No White Sugar</li><li>Less White Rice</li><li>Less Maida</li><li>Less Milk</li><li>Reduce Junk to Minimum or None.</li><li>Regular Food, because I can&#8217;t bear my hunger.</li></ol>



<p>I hated my body and want it to be in pain for becoming fat and not reducing my weight. ( I knew it was wrong later, but I shouldn&#8217;t forget the journey of my life). I literally challenged my body to gain weight since I was very sincere in the reduction of weight. Things started to fall under my control, some deviations here and there but the bigger picture was under my control.</p>



<p>One fine day my friend Poiyamozhi introduced me to Basket Ball. Some professional joined the game, my intention was just to keep moving my playtime was the same 1 hour but I ran, jogged, walked a lot, which reduced my weight faster. Faster the weight reduced more aggressive I start to involve in the game. I was the only person in the game who doesn&#8217;t know to play but keep chasing the opponent who has the ball try to snatch the ball from them, pass it to my team expert.</p>



<p>The Fiercefull fire in me made me fight against all my fat, hmm.. Good Times, as usual, doesn&#8217;t last long. I started to get body ache playing. One of the Expert Player Mr Cecil who was Ex Basket Ball Coacher taught me to warm up and warm down exercises. I did those exercise pre and post gameplay so that I am good after the game.</p>



<p>One fine day a spark came in my mind. Those warm down exercises are they yoga or not? I start to watch a lot of videos on the internet then I found that those are perfect yoga for stretching and relaxing various parts of the body.</p>



<p>I deep-dived into a lot of things which changed my life I guess.</p>



<h2>Phase 5: Our Life, Our Body, Our Rules</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Talk to yourself at least once in a Day&#8230; Otherwise, you may miss a meeting with an EXCELLENT person in this World.</p><cite>Swami Vivekananda</cite></blockquote>



<p>How many times have I spoken to myself like that? I then started to speak to my inner self at least once in a day from that day. Which made me realize that I had been fighting and cursing me instead of being compassionate with myself.</p>



<p>I started to follow some of the following</p>



<ol><li>Thiruvalluvar 500 BC Approx &#8211; He is the greatest philosopher I have ever seen</li><li>Dr G Sivaraman &#8211; Sidda Doctor</li><li>Dr BM Hegde</li><li>Ekhart Yoga &#8211; (Not sponsored by the way)</li></ol>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>No matter you are fat or thin, If you can walk full speed for 45 minutes, Touch all parts of your body with your hand, lift your own weight and wake up with the enthusiasm to do something good then you are leading a healthy life</p><cite>Karuthu Karthi &#8211; Author of Blog</cite></blockquote>



<p>With this knowledge, I prepared a killer plan which is flexible as per my need and achieves what I want.</p>



<h3>Made my Own Rule Version 2</h3>



<p>First Priority as healthy life and second priority as weight loss, Adhered to following things on the second version of my rule, Every point below came after intensive research done by myself so much research that every point requires a big blog to explain, which I will do later for sure.</p>



<ol><li>No to White Rice (Eat only when it is unavoidable)</li><li>Replace white rice with Red rice, Black rice, Foxtail millet, Finger millet, Pearl millet, Barnyard millet, Kodo millet, Little millet</li><li>White Sugar = Slow Poison</li><li>No Milk (Consume only if I am consuming Ayurveda Medicine which demands to)</li><li>A Very Good Yes to Buttermilk</li><li>No Pastries</li><li>Strict No to Oats</li><li>Eat Only when I am hungry, Eat Moderately</li><li>A Very Good Yes to Sesame Oil, Ground Nut Oil, Coconut Oil, Ghee, Butter</li><li>Strict No to White Leghorn Chickens and its Eggs ( I consume once in a while 1 or 2 pieces to quench my long term desire which I will soon stop)</li><li>Very Good Yes to Country Chicken, Country Chicken Eggs, Mutton,</li><li>Strict No Watching TV, Laptop, Mobile, Speaking and Thinking of something other than eating.</li><li>Close the mouth while chewing, Chew 32 times on Vegetarian and 50-70 times on Non-vegetarian foods.</li><li>Strict No to Non-Veg Meal after 6 PM</li><li>Mandatory Yoga 5 Days a Week.</li></ol>



<p>With all the above practices my ultimate goal was to stay healthy, Weight loss came to me as a byproduct. </p>



<h2>Phase 6: Journey to Wisdom</h2>



<p>Now with proper yoga 5 days a week and healthy eating, I still felt some ingredient missing towards a healthy life. Later I discovered that meditation is the next step of yoga, where the sole purpose of yoga is to get your mind and body ready for meditation. Back in olden days I tried meditation and failed. This time it felt a little bit less hard than the previous one.</p>



<p>I started to follow Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche a Buddhist Monk, he though me what is meditation in just 2 minutes, the question which I asked hundreds of people during the past decade.</p>



<p>I started my journey of meditation 5-15 minutes every day, by the time I write this blog I was in 6th week of meditation. True meditation needs years of practice, I am no way even close to them and I can&#8217;t even compare myself to any of true meditators. But I could say that I am consistently trying to meditate every day.</p>



<p>I will update my journey of meditation since I didn&#8217;t feel any benefits of meditation so far.</p>



<p>I have also dived myself into &#8220;<strong>Mindful Eating</strong>&#8220;. Every piece of food I swallow I know what I am eating, what kind of nutrition&#8217;s are there and what good it&#8217;s doing to my body and mind. So naturally, I start to avoid eating Junk and Unhealthy foods. I finally reached 65 Kg which was so wonderful.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>Started my journey as weight loss, transformed to healthy diet now transformed into a healthy mind and a healthy body. From Speed walking to Jogging to Playing to Yoga to Meditation is my short journey.</p>



<p>I am going to start my journey in Quantum Healing. As a Business Analyst, I should ask myself one question, Does the benefits I obtain worth the effort and time I invest? If the answer is yes, I am going to try no matter how many times I fail</p>



<p>The journey wasn&#8217;t easy, My persistence leads to my success, no matter how many times I failed I kept changing my strategy and never gave up.</p>

<p>We might know user stories, use cases, wireframe, prototype things like that. The project I worked demanded user story and use case at the same level. We created a use case for every user story. It may vary project to project. problem</p>



<p>As a Business Analyst, we often focus on adding value to the customer at the highest level and that&#8217;s absolutely normal. Most of the features which we propose and develop will be at the highest level of the project or organization. We may be flying and seeing iceberg and we see the top area, we may not be able to notice how big the iceberg below the water is. If we start to see the in details then there is a high chance that we could stick ourselves in and miss out the top view.</p>



<p>What can be done then?</p>

<p>Insights from image</p>



<p>Callout 1: The size of a tasks you see from Ariel view.</p>



<p>Callout 2: The assumed size of hidden tasks from Ariel view.</p>



<p>Callout 3: The actual size of tasks when you have a closer look.</p>



<p>Let me share my experience on how I handled it.</p>



<p>I came across a project where we had been working on top-level working on needs, value to stakeholders, managing the change and usual stuff like that.&nbsp; We were working in the top-down approach. As the sprints are nearing we started to break big epics to smaller stories, then work on those user stories. Everything was good.</p>



<p>A Business analyst in this disruptive business environment, I personally decided that I should not just do what the customer says, I should be driving an extra mile and understand what the customer needs. Customer may not say all their needs, not because they don’t want to its because they may not be connecting the dots as we do. We need to help them connect the dots for them, then the client will get a new business opportunity, which makes the client win. If the client wins we win.</p>



<p>While working on a project I met an end-user. Then I asked “Do u have any views on the wireframe which we did?” which is a silly question when looking from the top, but to the end-user, it’s a very relevant question as that person is going to work on that after live.</p>



<p>The end-user said that “it would be nice if you have a button to restore earlier configurations”. I was like “ok, I have noted down your suggestion, will discuss with the team and if it makes sense we will add it”. That didn’t make any sense to me. Back to my place I was having a walk and asking myself &#8220;Why can’t I connect the silly feature he said with the bigger picture?&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="59" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-6/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-6" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-59" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>The system is a complex one and it is proposed to have a lot of configurations. When few are changed accidentally or intentionally, this will create a huge ripple effect on the various process. If something is not working as per plan, it is very crucial to bring the system back to the previous Configuration or some of the configuration of earlier days ASAP. There is no possibility that the problem will occur in As-Is state, but it will for sure in To-Be state. Moreover there here are dozens of places where the configuration would impact. Then this must be looked into.</p>



<p>We went through the use cases again, the steps that are similar and getting repeated in various use cases at various times. Then we started to map those similar steps. We got clarity that this would start out to be a big problem if small things went wrong.</p>



<p>We connected the dots where a new use case was created, which saved several steps in various other use cases and also helped us to create a disaster recovery system.</p>



<p>Please refer to this image below</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Every use cases there are certain steps that are similar and repeating</li><li>Though we were are travelling in ariel view we dived deep and connect the dots at the right time.</li><li>With the connected Dots we created a new use case</li><li>This could save time for Client, and make them recover from problem quickly.</li></ol>



<p>so, the clients are happy we are happy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="60" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-7/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png" data-orig-size="455,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-7" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png?w=455" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png?w=455" alt="" class="wp-image-60" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png 455w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></figure>



<p>So, What I learned from the incident, The measures to improve or safeguard a business can come from any hierarchy. We need to hear to them and analyze to what extent it works.</p>

<p>You might be asking what is the customer journey map in the first place. It is just mapping the journey of a user in the workflow, it may be anywhere. Even buying a coffee in Starbucks? Yes, You are executing a Customer Journey Map there (by the way Starbucks didn’t sponsor me for this blog). Customer Journey Map seems to be so important in this era of the volatile business climate.</p>



<p>Earlier days Customers don’t have many choices its either Company A or Company B. But nowadays even 26 alphabets may not be enough as there are so many choices for customers, which means so many competitors for your business too.</p>



<p>Usually, customers are targeted and segmented using demographics. You will have to spend a lot of time, effort and money to reach your customers. Though you spend them and get your customers your competitor will be ready waiting behind you to snatch them from you at any instant.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="51" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-4/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-51" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>What could be done?</p>



<p>Some marketing expert would say that I have done all my target market analysis, market segmentation and all but I still not been able to sustain my customers.</p>



<p>Why can’t I get my customer to stay with me?</p>



<p>Its because you are not seeing through their eyes. You are not understanding their emotions. What? Emotions !!! We were not thought in any school to understand anyone&#8217;s emotions&#8230; Right?</p>



<p>Hey&#8230; Emotions are intangible things. Our business model didn’t teach to look for customers emotions. Just their problems and solutions.</p>



<p>Nowadays, Even if you are the monopoly of the business and you didn’t respond to the emotions of your customers, you are creating your own competitors. Let me tell you how.</p>



<p>Let us have 2 scenarios. You spend huge money and get reach your customers, Your competitor spends the same huge money and gets connected with your customers. Think who will win?</p>



<p>In Customers perspective, Company just reaching you vs company connecting with you. I guess you got it right.</p>



<p>To connect with a person you should understand their emotions just like understanding your partner&#8217;s emotions in relationships. You need to understand who they are? What do they care about? Why do they care about? If they are buying something from you ask, why they are buying from you? How much they are willing to pay for it?</p>



<p>Now here comes our saviour &#8220;<strong>The Psychograph</strong>&#8220;, So does it mean you have to trash your demographics and switch to Psychograph? No, you should not trash them. You use it with them. Consider Phycograph as a steroid to your demograph,</p>



<p>Use your demograph and Psychograph, try to connect both of them. there is a possibility that you may have to ignore some customer of your demographic, yes you have to. Re-Think Reaching vs Connecting, Which means more conversion ration, useful in long term survival.</p>



<p>Let me come to my personal experience, I was preparing a Customer Journey Map for &#8220;Conference / Event Management System&#8221; for Academics. I couldn’t prepare the Customer Journey Map properly, I was getting uneven results on every iteration. Instead, my map to converge on some area it kept diverging and unfocusing.</p>



<p>The Customers Goals, Activity, Touchpoints, Emotions don’t seem to align well with a business goal, KPI.</p>



<p>Then a spark came to my mind, The truth is every person is being controlled by emotions one way or another. Instead of connecting with customer goals blindly why can’t I try connecting their emotions which decides their goals?</p>



<p>I connected customers emotions which altered their goals, grouped the customers of similar emotions. In this journey, the Psychograph helped me a lot. I got a lot of profile.</p>



<p>Then I grouped those profile to the primary audience and secondary audience and so&#8230; Then prepared the Customer Journey Map. This time the workflow came out beautifully. I could align the customer&#8217;s goal with the business goal. I felt I was one step closer to the customer. I conducted a survey and confirmed my hypothesis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-5/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-5" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-53" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>Viola, I moved a step closer to my customer and connected well with them. Which lead to more conversion and less attrition.</p>



<p>I have attached a user journey map template with some sample data of my project along with the demographics and Psychograph. Please feel free to download and use it both professionally and personally.</p>

<p>Which comes first use case or user stories?</p>



<p>Well in my perspective it depends on the project you are working. The current project demanded the user stories to be on top.</p>



<p>That was just the start. All of a sudden user stories started to rain. I have patiently collected and in parallel, I started to deliver them into respective buckets and named those buckets “Epic”. Then I arranged those epics in the order of workflow and release plan. This is called “User Story Map”.</p>

<p>Well, that was a good start, the user story map started to grow bigger and bigger as more stories dropped into. Consolidating those stories helped me to see the forest through trees.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="45" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-2/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-45" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>It was a good kickstart… Next what? Dive into use cases.</p>



<p>I was thinking how much time would it take to write use cases for hundreds of user stories for dozens for epics lying out there. There was also a second thought in my mind, by the time I create use cases for all the epics and stories out here what happens if the user stories are not used? or if the market changes which forced the client to trash old user stories and dump with new stories.</p>



<p>Because Change is like Mr. Thanos from the Avengers Movie it often says I am inevitable. So we need to get ourselves ready for the inevitable change at any time and embrace it. This is Adaptive Development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="46" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-3/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png" data-orig-size="300,188" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=300" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=300" alt="" class="wp-image-46" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png 300w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure>



<p>Then I got a spark why to waste time on creating use cases for all user stories, instead create use cases for the ones which are at high priority or the one which is just enough to complete the process flow. We then linked a few user stories from each epic in to complete the workflow.</p>



<p>Viola !!! there comes the MVP – Minimum Viable Product, just enough product to complete the workflow at minimum time and budget. So what Client Happy, Project Manager Happy, Business Analyst Happy.. Market Happy? hmm&#8230; we just did this to check that out</p>



<p>Then I started to work on use cases for those user stories which are in MVP line. I intentionally let my foot into the client&#8217;s shoes, so I could understand their world.</p>



<p>This helped me to focus strictly on the user system interaction alone, nothing else. In my own words, I could call it a minimum viable use case.</p>



<p>Using the &#8220;use case&#8221; I started to prepare wireframe. This was the place where I realized the benefit. Sample Use Case below</p>



<p>The user indicates the system to log in</p>



<p>The system responds by requesting for mail id and password</p>



<p>The user inputs the mail id and password</p>



<p>The system checks for the authentication of the user</p>



<p>The system allows user into the system</p>



<p>The use case was so general that it can&#8217;t just be used for the website alone, it can be used for app or anything. Because I was not sure what is going to come because my client had too many Agent Smith&#8217;s with them. Luckily client decided to go for Website so I prepared wireframe for the website.</p>



<p>While preparing wireframe I use to see every line of the use case and prepare wireframe only for those and nothing else. This process saved a lot of time I mean a lot.</p>



<p>Usually, the monkey in my mind me will say Hey Karthi !!! add this feature, this will be nice&#8230; come on do this.. it will be impressive. I will listen to it and spend a lot of time and create a masterpiece. When I go out for a walk and come back the other monkey in my brain will say</p>



<p>&#8220;ahh… all these extra bells and whistles are good but where is the feature the client asked for?&#8221;</p>



<p>But this time I strictly stuck to the use case and nothing else. Wireframed the perfect Minimum Viable Product. It was so minimal that it didn’t have even a “Back Button” which I realized later.</p>



<p>The fun part was the website passed all the test cases defined in MVP without the &#8220;Back Button&#8221;. Creating Back Button would have been a good and essential feature but the team would have done little extra effort which would have cost a little more to the client.</p>



<p>This made me realize that creating a perfect use case before wireframing or prototyping could help me to create a perfect MVP successfully.</p>

<p>With a decent experience as a business analyst just touching the tip of the cloud technologies enabled me to see things in a new dimension.</p>



<p>I was involved in the automation of Conferences and Events focused on Academics and Research institutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workflow usually runs in a way that people submit their “Research Articles” to institutes which runs through a huge selection process. The Research Articles never be in one person&#8217;s custody it bounces like a basketball from one person to another then finally it&#8217;s selected or rejected or worst-case scenario: Starts its journey from first.</p>



<p class="has-huge-font-size"><em>“oh poor Research Article”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="33" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-33" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>&nbsp;This process cost lot of time, effort, meticulous follow up with the people having an article in hand. The fun part is all the communication is through mail or phone. Unproductive repetitive emails fall into every people’s inbox like a waterfall, it&#8217;s so hard and frustrating to find the important ones or just cc or bcc or some junk. By the time you sort things out you get hit by a bunch of emails saying and asking for different things.</p>



<p>If you have seen the movie &#8220;Bruce Almighty&#8221; you could get it</p>



<p>The project came to me at this level, the objective was to save time, unwanted man-hour and money to a client.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-huge-font-size"><em>“that&#8217;s sweet&#8230; What&#8230;? Hey!!! wait a minute..” </em></p>



<p>Where to Start?</p>



<p>Where to End?</p>



<p>How can that be achieved?</p>



<p>How to establish people to new process?</p>



<p>&nbsp;“hey brain that’s enough, for now, let us see how we can get that?”</p>



<p>We first started with the conventional workflow of the participants and interaction with the faculties. We mapped the emotions at each stage of both participants and faculty in the “customer journey map” Why emotions? Because that drives all ! you can see how we created the customer journey map in this link.</p>



<p>Post understanding the emotions we tried to semi-automate the areas where there are high occurrences of repeated or unwanted interaction. How? Very simple One source of truth for all, that truth source gets updated instantaneously from all possible direction. Hence people are redirected to that source of truth all times. Mailbox started to become lighter.</p>



<p class="has-huge-font-size"><em>Yay! I could see the light of Hope&#8230;</em></p>



<p>How did we achieve it?</p>



<p>We created a new workflow to semi-automate the submission, selection, scoring, commenting and notification of Research Article. Decomposed every part of the solution classified them based on Features and Releases.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>The top row represents the Features</li><li>Travelling from left to right for the workflow</li><li>Travelling from top to bottom on Releases where each release has a definite goal.</li><li>Grouped user stories into Epic ( I seriously don’t know what to name this user story group)</li><li>Joining certain user stories to achieve the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</li></ol>



<p>Up to this, I was working as a Business Analyst, but post this a spark came into my mind.</p>



<p>Why can’t I use my cloud knowledge in this?</p>



<p>Hence I proposed to split features into microservices. It requires another blog to explain why I did that, please use this link to read the blog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also speculated when the development team start to work it would be time-consuming to make them understand relevant feature with microservices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To solve this problem I went little out of way from traditional &#8220;User Story Map&#8221;. I just added a row mentioning the microservices that are involved in each feature. That&#8217;ss all folks&#8221;</p>



<p>That was very simple but it had a huge rippling effect.</p>



<ul><li>Enabled development team to know what cloud services need to be configured for each feature.</li><li>Which let them focus on that feature fully.</li><li>Which gave time to decouple all the features.</li><li>That let Clients rearrange the workflow as they wish</li><li>Which lets us to Scale-out or scale-in any feature independently</li><li>Which reduced the cost of the server&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, the app became more seamless and resilient.</li></ul>



<p>I am still unsure that this idea is right or wrong but this saved lot of time and money for our team as well as our client. Something like 5 people was doing the work which usually takes 20 people. Hence I am happy doing this.</p>



<p>Please feel free to download this picture and use it for your own purpose, if you make any modification in this that add value please let me know. I am curious to learn from you.</p>

<p>We have 2 answers for this question</p>



<p>Will explain all of these three</p>



<ol><li>Possible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</li><li>Impossible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</li></ol>



<h2>Possible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</h2>



<p>This is a booking a cab and travelling to the destination. The driver knows how to get you to the destination. In this case, you have a very fixed template in the execution of the project hence you will be having a full understanding of the project, how it works, the associated risks, the time required, human resources required, budget involved, stakeholders involved, inside scope and outside the scope.</p>



<p>Requirements like system upgrade, which are repeated initiative where the lessons learned from previous initiatives make yourself very clear and confident on this project execution. This works well in predictive methodology</p>



<h2>Impossible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</h2>



<p>This is where things get a little tricky. The client may not have a 100% clear idea of what they want. You could even ask how can a client ask you for a solution if they themselves are not clear on what they exactly want. in the current disruptive business environment the everything changes so fast, there were days where you will be excited when you just receive an item you ordered online a week earlier. but see now you want the item you ordered tomorrow itself or even today itself some cases you expect in few hours. the people mindset changes, which changes the market, which changes the competitors, which forces your client to change to the market to survive.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why your client may not be 100% clear of what they want. The reality is infinitely complex no matter how hard you think, how mature you are, how expert you are, you may not be able to predict everything accurately. Hence you won&#8217;t get 100% of requirement at any time. You have to start your work as soon as you verify the requirement of sufficient quality and validate your requirement with alignment with the goal then start your work.</p>



<p>Things may change anytime that&#8217;s a big risk, but not to worry that risk can be medicated with flexibility.</p>

<p>You might be asking what is the customer journey map in the first place. It is just mapping the journey of a user in the workflow, it may be anywhere. Even buying a coffee in Starbucks? Yes, You are executing a Customer Journey Map there (by the way Starbucks didn’t sponsor me). Customer Journey Map seems to be so important in this era of the volatile business climate.</p>



<p>Earlier days Customers don’t have many choices its either Company A or Company B. But nowadays even 26 alphabets may not be enough as there are so many choices for customers, which means many competitors for your business too.</p>



<p>Usually, customers are targeted and segmented using demographics. But even though you target them that way you will have a lot of competitors for your business. You will have to spend a lot of time, effort and money to reach your customers. Though you spend them and get your customers your competitor will be ready waiting behind you to grab them from you at any instant.</p>

<p>What could be done?</p>



<p>Some marketing expert would say that I have done all my target market analysis, market segmentation and all but I still not been able to get my customers.</p>



<p>Why can’t I get my customer to stay with me?</p>



<p>Its because you are not seeing through their eyes. You are not understanding their emotions. What? Emotions !!! you might say&#8230;</p>



<p>Hey&#8230; Emotions are intangible things; our business model didn’t teach to look for customers emotions. Just their problems and solutions.</p>



<p>Nowadays, Even if you are the monopoly of the business and you didn’t respond to the emotions of your customers, you are creating your own competitors. Let me tell you how.</p>



<p>Let us have 2 scenarios. You spend huge money and get reach your customers, Your competitor spends the same huge money and gets connected with your customers. Think who will win?</p>



<p>A Company just reaching you vs company connecting with you. I guess you got it right.</p>



<p>To connect with a person you should understand their emotions just like understanding your partner&#8217;s emotions in relationships. You need to understand who they are? What do they care about? Why do they care about? If they are buying something from you ask, why they are buying from you? How much they are willing to pay for it?</p>



<p>Now here comes our saviour &#8220;The Psychograph&#8221;, So does it mean you have to trash your demographics and switch to Psychograph? No, you should not trash them. You use it with them. Consider Phycograph as a steroid to your demograph,</p>



<p>Use your demograph and Psychograph, try to connect both of them. there is a possibility that you may have to ignore some customer of your demographic, yes you have to. Think Reaching vs Connecting, Which means more conversion ration, useful in long term survival.</p>



<p>Let me come to my personal experience, I was preparing a Customer Journey Map for &#8220;Conference / Event Management System&#8221; for Academics. I couldn’t prepare the Customer Journey Map properly, I was getting uneven results on every iteration. Instead, my map to converge on some area it kept diverging and unfocusing.</p>



<p>The Customers Goals, Activity, Touchpoints, Emotions don’t seem to align well with a business goal, KPI.</p>



<p>Then a spark came to my mind, The truth is every person is being controlled by emotions one way or another. Instead of connecting with customer goals blindly why can’t I try connecting their emotions which decides their goals?</p>



<p>I connected customers emotions which altered their goals, grouped the customers of similar emotions. In this journey, the Psychograph helped me a lot. I got a lot of profile.</p>



<p>Then I grouped those profile to the primary audience and secondary audience and so&#8230; Then prepared the Customer Journey Map. This time the workflow came out beautifully. I could align the customer&#8217;s goal with the business goal. I felt I was one step closer to the customer. I conducted a survey and confirmed my hypothesis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-5/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-5" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-53" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>Viola, I moved a step closer to my customer and connected well with them. Which lead to more conversion and less attrition.</p>



<p>I have attached a user journey map template with some sample data of my project along with the demographics and Psychograph. Please feel free to download and use it both professionally and personally.</p>

<p>Which comes first use case or user stories?</p>



<p>Well in my perspective it depends on the project you are working. The current project demanded the user stories to be on top.</p>



<p>That was just the start. All of a sudden user stories started to rain. I have patiently collected and in parallel, I started to deliver them into respective buckets and named those buckets “Epic”. Then I arranged those epics in the order of workflow and release plan. This is called “User Story Map”.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="44" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-1/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-1.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-1.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-1.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-44" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-1.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-1.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-1.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>Well, that was a good start, the user story map started to grow bigger and bigger as more stories dropped into. Consolidating those stories helped me to see the forest through trees.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="45" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-2/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-45" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>It was a good kickstart… Next what? Dive into use cases.</p>



<p>I was thinking how much time would it take to write use cases for hundreds of user stories for dozens for epics lying out there. There was also a second thought in my mind, by the time I create use cases for all the epics and stories out here what happens if the user stories are not used? or if the market changes which forced the client to trash old user stories and dump with new stories.</p>



<p>Because Change is like Mr. Thanos from the Avengers Movie it often says I am inevitable. So we need to get ourselves ready for the inevitable change at any time and embrace it. This is Adaptive Development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="46" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-3/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png" data-orig-size="300,188" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=300" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=300" alt="" class="wp-image-46" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png 300w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure>



<p>Then I got a spark why to waste time on creating use cases for all user stories, instead create use cases for the ones which are at high priority or the one which is just enough to complete the process flow. We then linked a few user stories from each epic in to complete the workflow.</p>



<p>Viola !!! there comes the MVP – Minimum Viable Product, just enough product to complete the workflow at minimum time and budget. So what Client Happy, Project Manager Happy, Business Analyst Happy.. Market Happy? hmm&#8230; we just did this to check that out</p>



<p>Then I started to work on use cases for those user stories which are in MVP line. I intentionally let my foot into the client&#8217;s shoes, so I could understand their world.</p>



<p>This helped me to focus strictly on the user system interaction alone, nothing else. In my own words, I could call it a minimum viable use case.</p>



<p>Using the &#8220;use case&#8221; I started to prepare wireframe. This was the place where I realized the benefit. Sample Use Case below</p>



<p>The user indicates the system to log in</p>



<p>The system responds by requesting for mail id and password</p>



<p>The user inputs the mail id and password</p>



<p>The system checks for the authentication of the user</p>



<p>The system allows user into the system</p>



<p>The use case was so general that it can&#8217;t just be used for the website alone, it can be used for app or anything. Because I was not sure what is going to come because my client had too many Agent Smith&#8217;s with them. Luckily client decided to go for Website so I prepared wireframe for the website.</p>



<p>While preparing wireframe I use to see every line of the use case and prepare wireframe only for those and nothing else. This process saved a lot of time I mean a lot.</p>



<p>Usually, the monkey in my mind me will say Hey Karthi !!! add this feature, this will be nice&#8230; come on do this.. it will be impressive. I will listen to it and spend a lot of time and create a masterpiece. When I go out for a walk and come back the other monkey in my brain will say</p>



<p>&#8220;ahh… all these extra bells and whistles are good but where is the feature the client asked for?&#8221;</p>



<p>But this time I strictly stuck to the use case and nothing else. Wireframed the perfect Minimum Viable Product. It was so minimal that it didn’t have even a “Back Button” which I realized later.</p>



<p>The fun part was the website passed all the test cases defined in MVP without the &#8220;Back Button&#8221;. Creating Back Button would have been a good and essential feature but the team would have done little extra effort which would have cost a little more to the client.</p>



<p>This made me realize that creating a perfect use case before wireframing or prototyping could help me to create a perfect MVP successfully.</p>



<p>Please feel free to use these illustrations for your personal and professional use.</p>

<p>With a decent experience as a business analyst just touching the tip of the cloud technologies enabled me to see things in a new dimension.</p>



<p>I was involved in the automation of Conferences and Events focused on Academics and Research institutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workflow usually runs in a way that people submit their “Research Articles” to institutes which runs through a huge selection process. The Research Articles never be in one person&#8217;s custody it bounces like a basketball from one person to another then finally it&#8217;s selected or rejected or worst-case scenario: Starts its journey from first.</p>



<p class="has-huge-font-size"><em>“oh poor Research Article”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="33" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-33" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>&nbsp;This process cost lot of time, effort, meticulous follow up with the people having an article in hand. The fun part is all the communication is through mail or phone. Unproductive repetitive emails fall into every people’s inbox like a waterfall, it&#8217;s so hard and frustrating to find the important ones or just cc or bcc or some junk. By the time you sort things out you get hit by a bunch of emails saying and asking for different things.</p>



<p>If you have seen the movie &#8220;Bruce Almighty&#8221; you could get it</p>



<p>The project came to me at this level, the objective was to save time, unwanted man-hour and money to a client.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-huge-font-size"><em>“that&#8217;s sweet&#8230; What&#8230;? Hey!!! wait a minute..” </em></p>



<p>Where to Start?</p>



<p>Where to End?</p>



<p>How can that be achieved?</p>



<p>How to establish people to new process?</p>



<p>&nbsp;“hey brain that’s enough, for now, let us see how we can get that?”</p>



<p>We first started with the conventional workflow of the participants and interaction with the faculties. We mapped the emotions at each stage of both participants and faculty in the “customer journey map” Why emotions? Because that drives all ! you can see how we created the customer journey map in this link.</p>



<p>Post understanding the emotions we tried to semi-automate the areas where there are high occurrences of repeated or unwanted interaction. How? Very simple One source of truth for all, that truth source gets updated instantaneously from all possible direction. Hence people are redirected to that source of truth all times. Mailbox started to become lighter.</p>



<p class="has-huge-font-size"><em>Yay! I could see the light of Hope&#8230;</em></p>



<p>How did we achieve it?</p>



<p>We created a new workflow to semi-automate the submission, selection, scoring, commenting and notification of Research Article. Decomposed every part of the solution classified them based on Features and Releases.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>The top row represents the Features</li><li>Travelling from left to right for the workflow</li><li>Travelling from top to bottom on Releases where each release has a definite goal.</li><li>Grouped user stories into Epic ( I seriously don’t know what to name this user story group)</li><li>Joining certain user stories to achieve the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</li></ol>



<p>Up to this, I was working as a Business Analyst, but post this a spark came into my mind.</p>



<p>Why can’t I use my cloud knowledge in this?</p>



<p>Hence I proposed to split features into microservices. It requires another blog to explain why I did that, please use this link to read the blog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also speculated when the development team start to work it would be time-consuming to make them understand relevant feature with microservices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To solve this problem I went little out of way from traditional &#8220;User Story Map&#8221;. I just added a row mentioning the microservices that are involved in each feature. That&#8217;ss all folks&#8221;</p>



<p>That was very simple but it had a huge rippling effect.</p>



<ul><li>Enabled development team to know what cloud services need to be configured for each feature.</li><li>Which let them focus on that feature fully.</li><li>Which gave time to decouple all the features.</li><li>That let Clients rearrange the workflow as they wish</li><li>Which lets us to Scale-out or scale-in any feature independently</li><li>Which reduced the cost of the server&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, the app became more seamless and resilient.</li></ul>



<p>I am still unsure that this idea is right or wrong but this saved lot of time and money for our team as well as our client. Something like 5 people was doing the work which usually takes 20 people. Hence I am happy doing this.</p>



<p>Please feel free to download this picture and use it for your own purpose, if you make any modification in this that add value please let me know. I am curious to learn from you.</p>

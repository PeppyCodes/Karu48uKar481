<p>We have 2 answers for this question</p>



<p>Will explain all of these three</p>



<ol><li>Possible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</li><li>Impossible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</li></ol>



<h2>Possible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</h2>



<p>This is a booking a cab and travelling to the destination. The driver knows how to get you to the destination. In this case, you have a very fixed template in the execution of the project hence you will be having a full understanding of the project, how it works, the associated risks, the time required, human resources required, budget involved, stakeholders involved, inside scope and outside the scope.</p>



<p>Requirements like system upgrade, which are repeated initiative where the lessons learned from previous initiatives make yourself very clear and confident on this project execution. This works well in predictive methodology</p>



<h2>Impossible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</h2>



<p>This is where things get a little tricky. The client may not have a 100% clear idea of what they want. You could even ask how can a client ask you for a solution if they themselves are not clear on what they exactly want. in the current disruptive business environment the everything changes so fast, there were days where you will be excited when you just receive an item you ordered online a week earlier. but see now you want the item you ordered tomorrow itself or even today itself some cases you expect in few hours. the people mindset changes, which changes the market, which changes the competitors, which forces your client to change to the market to survive.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why your client may not be 100% clear of what they want. The reality is infinitely complex no matter how hard you think, how mature you are, how expert you are, you may not be able to predict everything accurately. Hence you won&#8217;t get 100% of requirement at any time. You have to start your work as soon as you verify the requirement of sufficient quality and validate your requirement with alignment with the goal then start your work.</p>



<p>Things may change anytime that&#8217;s a big risk, but not to worry that risk can be medicated with flexibility.</p>

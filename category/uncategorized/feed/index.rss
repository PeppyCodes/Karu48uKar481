<p>We might know user stories, use cases, wireframe, prototype things like that. The project I worked demanded user story and use case at the same level. We created a use case for every user story. It may vary project to project. problem</p>



<p>As a Business Analyst, we often focus on adding value to the customer at the highest level and that&#8217;s absolutely normal. Most of the features which we propose and develop will be at the highest level of the project or organization. We may be flying and seeing iceberg and we see the top area, we may not be able to notice how big the iceberg below the water is. If we start to see the in details then there is a high chance that we could stick ourselves in and miss out the top view.</p>



<p>What can be done then?</p>

<p>Insights from image</p>



<p>Callout 1: The size of a tasks you see from Ariel view.</p>



<p>Callout 2: The assumed size of hidden tasks from Ariel view.</p>



<p>Callout 3: The actual size of tasks when you have a closer look.</p>



<p>Let me share my experience on how I handled it.</p>



<p>I came across a project where we had been working on top-level working on needs, value to stakeholders, managing the change and usual stuff like that.&nbsp; We were working in the top-down approach. As the sprints are nearing we started to break big epics to smaller stories, then work on those user stories. Everything was good.</p>



<p>A Business analyst in this disruptive business environment, I personally decided that I should not just do what the customer says, I should be driving an extra mile and understand what the customer needs. Customer may not say all their needs, not because they don’t want to its because they may not be connecting the dots as we do. We need to help them connect the dots for them, then the client will get a new business opportunity, which makes the client win. If the client wins we win.</p>



<p>While working on a project I met an end-user. Then I asked “Do u have any views on the wireframe which we did?” which is a silly question when looking from the top, but to the end-user, it’s a very relevant question as that person is going to work on that after live.</p>



<p>The end-user said that “it would be nice if you have a button to restore earlier configurations”. I was like “ok, I have noted down your suggestion, will discuss with the team and if it makes sense we will add it”. That didn’t make any sense to me. Back to my place I was having a walk and asking myself &#8220;Why can’t I connect the silly feature he said with the bigger picture?&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="59" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-6/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-6" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-59" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>The system is a complex one and it is proposed to have a lot of configurations. When few are changed accidentally or intentionally, this will create a huge ripple effect on the various process. If something is not working as per plan, it is very crucial to bring the system back to the previous Configuration or some of the configuration of earlier days ASAP. There is no possibility that the problem will occur in As-Is state, but it will for sure in To-Be state. Moreover there here are dozens of places where the configuration would impact. Then this must be looked into.</p>



<p>We went through the use cases again, the steps that are similar and getting repeated in various use cases at various times. Then we started to map those similar steps. We got clarity that this would start out to be a big problem if small things went wrong.</p>



<p>We connected the dots where a new use case was created, which saved several steps in various other use cases and also helped us to create a disaster recovery system.</p>



<p>Please refer to this image below</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Every use cases there are certain steps that are similar and repeating</li><li>Though we were are travelling in ariel view we dived deep and connect the dots at the right time.</li><li>With the connected Dots we created a new use case</li><li>This could save time for Client, and make them recover from problem quickly.</li></ol>



<p>so, the clients are happy we are happy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="60" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-7/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png" data-orig-size="455,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-7" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png?w=455" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png?w=455" alt="" class="wp-image-60" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png 455w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-7.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></figure>



<p>So, What I learned from the incident, The measures to improve or safeguard a business can come from any hierarchy. We need to hear to them and analyze to what extent it works.</p>

<p>You might be asking what is the customer journey map in the first place. It is just mapping the journey of a user in the workflow, it may be anywhere. Even buying a coffee in Starbucks? Yes, You are executing a Customer Journey Map there (by the way Starbucks didn’t sponsor me). Customer Journey Map seems to be so important in this era of the volatile business climate.</p>



<p>Earlier days Customers don’t have many choices its either Company A or Company B. But nowadays even 26 alphabets may not be enough as there are so many choices for customers, which means many competitors for your business too.</p>



<p>Usually, customers are targeted and segmented using demographics. But even though you target them that way you will have a lot of competitors for your business. You will have to spend a lot of time, effort and money to reach your customers. Though you spend them and get your customers your competitor will be ready waiting behind you to grab them from you at any instant.</p>

<p>What could be done?</p>



<p>Some marketing expert would say that I have done all my target market analysis, market segmentation and all but I still not been able to get my customers.</p>



<p>Why can’t I get my customer to stay with me?</p>



<p>Its because you are not seeing through their eyes. You are not understanding their emotions. What? Emotions !!! you might say&#8230;</p>



<p>Hey&#8230; Emotions are intangible things; our business model didn’t teach to look for customers emotions. Just their problems and solutions.</p>



<p>Nowadays, Even if you are the monopoly of the business and you didn’t respond to the emotions of your customers, you are creating your own competitors. Let me tell you how.</p>



<p>Let us have 2 scenarios. You spend huge money and get reach your customers, Your competitor spends the same huge money and gets connected with your customers. Think who will win?</p>



<p>A Company just reaching you vs company connecting with you. I guess you got it right.</p>



<p>To connect with a person you should understand their emotions just like understanding your partner&#8217;s emotions in relationships. You need to understand who they are? What do they care about? Why do they care about? If they are buying something from you ask, why they are buying from you? How much they are willing to pay for it?</p>



<p>Now here comes our saviour &#8220;The Psychograph&#8221;, So does it mean you have to trash your demographics and switch to Psychograph? No, you should not trash them. You use it with them. Consider Phycograph as a steroid to your demograph,</p>



<p>Use your demograph and Psychograph, try to connect both of them. there is a possibility that you may have to ignore some customer of your demographic, yes you have to. Think Reaching vs Connecting, Which means more conversion ration, useful in long term survival.</p>



<p>Let me come to my personal experience, I was preparing a Customer Journey Map for &#8220;Conference / Event Management System&#8221; for Academics. I couldn’t prepare the Customer Journey Map properly, I was getting uneven results on every iteration. Instead, my map to converge on some area it kept diverging and unfocusing.</p>



<p>The Customers Goals, Activity, Touchpoints, Emotions don’t seem to align well with a business goal, KPI.</p>



<p>Then a spark came to my mind, The truth is every person is being controlled by emotions one way or another. Instead of connecting with customer goals blindly why can’t I try connecting their emotions which decides their goals?</p>



<p>I connected customers emotions which altered their goals, grouped the customers of similar emotions. In this journey, the Psychograph helped me a lot. I got a lot of profile.</p>



<p>Then I grouped those profile to the primary audience and secondary audience and so&#8230; Then prepared the Customer Journey Map. This time the workflow came out beautifully. I could align the customer&#8217;s goal with the business goal. I felt I was one step closer to the customer. I conducted a survey and confirmed my hypothesis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-5/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-5" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-53" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>Viola, I moved a step closer to my customer and connected well with them. Which lead to more conversion and less attrition.</p>



<p>I have attached a user journey map template with some sample data of my project along with the demographics and Psychograph. Please feel free to download and use it both professionally and personally.</p>

<p>Which comes first use case or user stories?</p>



<p>Well in my perspective it depends on the project you are working. The current project demanded the user stories to be on top.</p>



<p>That was just the start. All of a sudden user stories started to rain. I have patiently collected and in parallel, I started to deliver them into respective buckets and named those buckets “Epic”. Then I arranged those epics in the order of workflow and release plan. This is called “User Story Map”.</p>

<p>Well, that was a good start, the user story map started to grow bigger and bigger as more stories dropped into. Consolidating those stories helped me to see the forest through trees.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="45" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-2/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-45" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>It was a good kickstart… Next what? Dive into use cases.</p>



<p>I was thinking how much time would it take to write use cases for hundreds of user stories for dozens for epics lying out there. There was also a second thought in my mind, by the time I create use cases for all the epics and stories out here what happens if the user stories are not used? or if the market changes which forced the client to trash old user stories and dump with new stories.</p>



<p>Because Change is like Mr. Thanos from the Avengers Movie it often says I am inevitable. So we need to get ourselves ready for the inevitable change at any time and embrace it. This is Adaptive Development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="46" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-3/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png" data-orig-size="300,188" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=300" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=300" alt="" class="wp-image-46" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png 300w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure>



<p>Then I got a spark why to waste time on creating use cases for all user stories, instead create use cases for the ones which are at high priority or the one which is just enough to complete the process flow. We then linked a few user stories from each epic in to complete the workflow.</p>



<p>Viola !!! there comes the MVP – Minimum Viable Product, just enough product to complete the workflow at minimum time and budget. So what Client Happy, Project Manager Happy, Business Analyst Happy.. Market Happy? hmm&#8230; we just did this to check that out</p>



<p>Then I started to work on use cases for those user stories which are in MVP line. I intentionally let my foot into the client&#8217;s shoes, so I could understand their world.</p>



<p>This helped me to focus strictly on the user system interaction alone, nothing else. In my own words, I could call it a minimum viable use case.</p>



<p>Using the &#8220;use case&#8221; I started to prepare wireframe. This was the place where I realized the benefit. Sample Use Case below</p>



<p>The user indicates the system to log in</p>



<p>The system responds by requesting for mail id and password</p>



<p>The user inputs the mail id and password</p>



<p>The system checks for the authentication of the user</p>



<p>The system allows user into the system</p>



<p>The use case was so general that it can&#8217;t just be used for the website alone, it can be used for app or anything. Because I was not sure what is going to come because my client had too many Agent Smith&#8217;s with them. Luckily client decided to go for Website so I prepared wireframe for the website.</p>



<p>While preparing wireframe I use to see every line of the use case and prepare wireframe only for those and nothing else. This process saved a lot of time I mean a lot.</p>



<p>Usually, the monkey in my mind me will say Hey Karthi !!! add this feature, this will be nice&#8230; come on do this.. it will be impressive. I will listen to it and spend a lot of time and create a masterpiece. When I go out for a walk and come back the other monkey in my brain will say</p>



<p>&#8220;ahh… all these extra bells and whistles are good but where is the feature the client asked for?&#8221;</p>



<p>But this time I strictly stuck to the use case and nothing else. Wireframed the perfect Minimum Viable Product. It was so minimal that it didn’t have even a “Back Button” which I realized later.</p>



<p>The fun part was the website passed all the test cases defined in MVP without the &#8220;Back Button&#8221;. Creating Back Button would have been a good and essential feature but the team would have done little extra effort which would have cost a little more to the client.</p>



<p>This made me realize that creating a perfect use case before wireframing or prototyping could help me to create a perfect MVP successfully.</p>

<p>We might know user stories, use cases, wireframe, prototype things like that. The project I worked demanded user story and use case at the same level. We created a use case for every user story. It may vary project to project. problem</p>



<p>As a Business Analyst, we often focus on adding value to the customer at the highest level and that&#8217;s absolutely normal. Most of the features which we propose and develop will be at the highest level of the project or organization. We may be flying and seeing iceberg and we see the top area, we may not be able to notice how big the iceberg below the water is. If we start to see the in details then there is a high chance that we could stick ourselves in and miss out the top view.</p>



<p>What can be done then?</p>

<p>Insights from image</p>



<p>Callout 1: The size of a tasks you see from Ariel view.</p>



<p>Callout 2: The assumed size of hidden tasks from Ariel view.</p>



<p>Callout 3: The actual size of tasks when you have a closer look.</p>



<p>Let me share my experience on how I handled it.</p>



<p>I came across a project where we had been working on top-level working on needs, value to stakeholders, managing the change and usual stuff like that.&nbsp; We were working in the top-down approach. As the sprints are nearing we started to break big epics to smaller stories, then work on those user stories. Everything was good.</p>



<p>A Business analyst in this disruptive business environment, I personally decided that I should not just do what the customer says, I should be driving an extra mile and understand what the customer needs. Customer may not say all their needs, not because they don’t want to its because they may not be connecting the dots as we do. We need to help them connect the dots for them, then the client will get a new business opportunity, which makes the client win. If the client wins we win.</p>



<p>While working on a project I met an end-user. Then I asked “Do u have any views on the wireframe which we did?” which is a silly question when looking from the top, but to the end-user, it’s a very relevant question as that person is going to work on that after live.</p>



<p>The end-user said that “it would be nice if you have a button to restore earlier configurations”. I was like “ok, I have noted down your suggestion, will discuss with the team and if it makes sense we will add it”. That didn’t make any sense to me. Back to my place I was having a walk and asking myself &#8220;Why can’t I connect the silly feature he said with the bigger picture?&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="59" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/image-6/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png" data-orig-size="602,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-6" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=602" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=602" alt="" class="wp-image-59" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png 602w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>The system is a complex one and it is proposed to have a lot of configurations. When few are changed accidentally or intentionally, this will create a huge ripple effect on the various process. If something is not working as per plan, it is very crucial to bring the system back to the previous Configuration or some of the configuration of earlier days ASAP. There is no possibility that the problem will occur in As-Is state, but it will for sure in To-Be state. Moreover there here are dozens of places where the configuration would impact. Then this must be looked into.</p>



<p>We went through the use cases again, the steps that are similar and getting repeated in various use cases at various times. Then we started to map those similar steps. We got clarity that this would start out to be a big problem if small things went wrong.</p>



<p>We connected the dots where a new use case was created, which saved several steps in various other use cases and also helped us to create a disaster recovery system.</p>



<p>Please refer to this image below</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Every use cases there are certain steps that are similar and repeating</li><li>Though we were are travelling in ariel view we dived deep and connect the dots at the right time.</li><li>With the connected Dots we created a new use case</li><li>This could save time for Client, and make them recover from problem quickly.</li></ol>



<p>so, the clients are happy we are happy.</p>

<p>So, What I learned from the incident, The measures to improve or safeguard a business can come from any hierarchy. We need to hear to them and analyze to what extent it works.</p>

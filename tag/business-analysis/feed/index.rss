					<description><![CDATA[This blog is all about how planning and documentation saved me from unwanted blames during tough times in an initiative.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In this blog, I would explain how planning and documentation saved me at difficult times.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If You Fail to Plan, You Plan to Fail!</p><cite>Benjamin Franklin</cite></blockquote>



<p>Luckily I had known this before the project start, so I have done the following before and during the project life cycle.</p>



<ul><li>Finalized the Project Scope</li><li>Built High-Level Business Analysis approach</li><li>Made sure stakeholders are Identified and planned to get engaged</li><li>A measure of success in project implementation had been set</li><li>Change management had been introduced</li><li>Documenting the Change in scope at every stage</li></ul>



<p>The project started, the objective of the project was to save the time of employees so that the efficiency of the man-hour is improved. Its a startup Business Intelligence firm.</p>



<p>Requirements and designs are frequently updated, that&#8217;s good. because change is good. Even the high-level requirement had been updated every day, it&#8217;s like today&#8217;s update is no way relevant to yesterdays work. But here is where things started to get a little fishy.</p>



<p>Since the deadline was approaching Business Analysis work had been started in a hurry without having proper time to analyze to what extent this change aligns to the scope of the project. </p>



<p>The project had been moving on this phase for some weeks, I started to sense that the project is not going in the right direction. every stakeholder and business analysis team had been working on day and night but the rock wasn&#8217;t moving an inch.</p>



<p>I felt like I and all stakeholders were trying to push and pull the big rock, but unsure of the direction, Though directions had been shown.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="175" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/blog-rock3-1/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-rock3-1.jpg" data-orig-size="1919,859" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="blog-rock3-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-rock3-1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-rock3-1.jpg?w=750" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-rock3-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-175" /></figure>



<p>In both Figure 1 and Figure 2 lot of efforts had been put into, But look closely</p>



<ul><li><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The rock had been pushed and pulled in full effort, the direction of different person are different and incongruent, so the rock remains almost stationary and most efforts are wasted.</li><li><strong>Figure 2: </strong>The rock had been pushed and pulled in full effort, the direction of different person are different. But collectively the project moves in a direction. though the progress is little slow this is what should happen..</li></ul>



<p>This made me to decide not to accept all changes just like that instead put those change into a change management process so that the changes are relevant to the objective of the initiative. This made the stakeholders to loose the collaboration.</p>



<p>No Time to think, just discuss and do. Although in this tough situation where I didn&#8217;t have proper time to eat, were sometimes working even on Sundays, I tried to document everything that&#8217;s happening. At some point in time, I even felt &#8220;I should work instead of documenting because documentation wastes time&#8221; but my inner consciousness said documenting is worth the time. </p>



<p>Weeks moved on like this. New Changes today, which is less relevant to yesterday, which is very less relevant to goal and objective of the initiative.</p>



<p>One fine day I got questions from the client</p>



<ul><li>What had you guys been doing all these days?</li><li>Where are the benefits?</li><li>We don&#8217;t have any results yet? deadline is approaching !!!</li></ul>



<p>I tried to explain the number of changes without alignment lead to this &#8220;the rock story&#8221;. They were not convinced. Then I took out the documentation which I did on every day, presented to them. Client agreed then.</p>



<p>The client requested for restarting the project, But they want some traditional methodology to handle their work. I very well knew that it will lead to failure down the line, explained them with enough data and lessons learned that the project will move towards point of failure. Client was pretty much stuck on the current methodology. I felt that starting again will definitely lead to failure again which is waste of time and money for client as well as me. Hence I dropped the project.</p>



<p>Had I not done the documentation and explained the client, the entire blame of project failure would have dropped on Business Analysis. Good that I was considerably good in planning and documentation which saved me.</p>

<p>We have 2 answers for this question</p>



<p>Will explain all of these three</p>



<ol><li>Possible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</li><li>Impossible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</li></ol>



<h2>Possible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</h2>



<p>This is a booking a cab and travelling to the destination. The driver knows how to get you to the destination. In this case, you have a very fixed template in the execution of the project hence you will be having a full understanding of the project, how it works, the associated risks, the time required, human resources required, budget involved, stakeholders involved, inside scope and outside the scope.</p>



<p>Requirements like system upgrade, which are repeated initiative where the lessons learned from previous initiatives make yourself very clear and confident on this project execution. This works well in predictive methodology</p>



<h2>Impossible to Gather 100% of the Requirement</h2>



<p>This is where things get a little tricky. The client may not have a 100% clear idea of what they want. You could even ask how can a client ask you for a solution if they themselves are not clear on what they exactly want. in the current disruptive business environment the everything changes so fast, there were days where you will be excited when you just receive an item you ordered online a week earlier. but see now you want the item you ordered tomorrow itself or even today itself some cases you expect in few hours. the people mindset changes, which changes the market, which changes the competitors, which forces your client to change to the market to survive.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why your client may not be 100% clear of what they want. The reality is infinitely complex no matter how hard you think, how mature you are, how expert you are, you may not be able to predict everything accurately. Hence you won&#8217;t get 100% of requirement at any time. You have to start your work as soon as you verify the requirement of sufficient quality and validate your requirement with alignment with the goal then start your work.</p>



<p>Things may change anytime that&#8217;s a big risk, but not to worry that risk can be medicated with flexibility.</p>

<p>As a business analyst just touching the tip of the cloud technologies enabled me to see things in a new dimension.</p>



<p>I was involved in the automation of Conferences and Events focused on Academics and Research institutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workflow usually runs in a way that people submit their “Research Articles” to institutes which runs through a huge selection process. The Research Articles never be in one person&#8217;s custody it bounces like a basketball from one person to another then finally it&#8217;s selected or rejected or worst-case scenario: Starts its journey from first.</p>



<p class="has-huge-font-size"><em>“oh poor Research Article”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="185" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/dopamine1/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/dopamine1.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,976" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="dopamine1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/dopamine1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/dopamine1.jpg?w=750" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/dopamine1.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-185" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/dopamine1.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/dopamine1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/dopamine1.jpg?w=300 300w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/dopamine1.jpg?w=768 768w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/dopamine1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p> This process cost lot of time, effort, meticulous follow up with the people having an article in hand causing lot of friction among people. The fun part is all the communication is through mail or phone. Unproductive repetitive emails fall into every people’s inbox like a waterfall, it&#8217;s so hard and frustrating to find the important ones or just cc or bcc or some junk. By the time you sort things out you get hit by a bunch of emails saying and asking for different things.</p>



<p>If you have seen the movie &#8220;Bruce Almighty&#8221; you could get it</p>



<p>The project came to me at this level, the objective was to save time, unwanted man-hour and money to a client.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-huge-font-size"><em>“that&#8217;s sweet&#8230; What&#8230;? Hey!!! wait a minute..”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Where to Start?</p>



<p>Where to End?</p>



<p>How can that be achieved?</p>



<p>How to establish people to new process?</p>



<p>&nbsp;“hey brain that’s enough, for now, let us see how we can get that?”</p>



<p>We first started with the conventional workflow of the participants and interaction with the faculties. We mapped the emotions at each stage of both participants and faculty in the “customer journey map” Why emotions? Because that drives all ! you can see how we created the customer journey map in this link.</p>



<p>Post understanding the emotions we tried to semi-automate the areas where there are high occurrences of repeated or unwanted interaction. How? Very simple One source of truth for all, that truth source gets updated instantaneously from all possible direction. Hence people are redirected to that source of truth all times. Mailbox started to become lighter.</p>



<p class="has-huge-font-size"><em>Yay! I could see the light of Hope&#8230;</em></p>



<p>How did we achieve it?</p>



<p>We created a new workflow to semi-automate the submission, selection, scoring, commenting and notification of Research Article. Decomposed every part of the solution classified them based on Features and Releases.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="186" data-permalink="https://karuthukarthi.wordpress.com/blog-2-2/" data-orig-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-2.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,976" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="blog-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-2.jpg?w=750" src="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-2.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-186" srcset="https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-2.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-2.jpg?w=768 768w, https://karuthukarthi.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/blog-2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<ol type="1"><li>The top row represents the Features</li><li>Travelling from left to right for the workflow</li><li>Travelling from top to bottom on Releases where each release has a definite goal.</li><li>Grouped user stories into Epic ( I seriously don’t know what to name this user story group)</li><li>Joining certain user stories to achieve the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</li></ol>



<p>Up to this, I was working as a Business Analyst, but post this a spark came into my mind.</p>



<p>Why can’t I use my cloud knowledge in this?</p>



<p>Hence I proposed to split features into microservices. It requires another blog to explain why I did that, please use this link to read the blog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also speculated when the development team start to work it would be time-consuming to make them understand relevant feature with microservices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To solve this problem I went little out of way from traditional &#8220;User Story Map&#8221;. I just added a row mentioning the microservices that are involved in each feature. That&#8217;s all folks&#8221;</p>



<p>That was very simple but it had a huge rippling effect.</p>



<ul><li>Enabled development team to know what cloud services need to be configured for each feature.</li><li>Which let them focus on that feature fully.</li><li>Which gave time to decouple all the features.</li><li>That let Clients rearrange the workflow as they wish</li><li>Which lets us to Scale-out or scale-in any feature independently</li><li>Which reduced the cost of the server&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, the app became more seamless and resilient.</li></ul>



<p>I am still unsure that this idea is right or wrong but this saved lot of time and money for our team as well as our client. Something like 5 people was doing the work which usually takes 20 people. Hence I am happy doing this.</p>



<p>Please feel free to download this picture and use it for your own purpose, if you make any modification in this that add value please let me know. I am curious to learn from you.</p>
